A word cloud is a visual representation of text data that displays words in different sizes. The more frequent a word appears in the source text, the larger it appears in the word cloud. Words are also arranged with some degree of randomness, clustered together in a shape reminiscent of a cloud. The color scheme can vary, but words are usually displayed in shades of a single color or a gradient. The goal of a word cloud is to quickly perceive the most prominent terms and themes in a body of text. It provides a visual overview of key words and concepts by emphasizing words that appear most often. The larger size draws the eye to the terms that are most frequent or significant in the text data. <br>
